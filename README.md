# Anfisa as achievement indicator

Anfisa is like a dog, you can't feed her anymore, but you can't just leave her like that. Therefore, it was decided to keep it as a result of my training this month, of course it is extremely small, but here it is.

This is a project that processes requests about the weather or the presence of friends (yes, you got it right - this is something like a stripped-down browser).

## The benefit, of course, for me

While I was writing the project, I was repeating and discovering a lot of theory in parallel, specifically:
- Algorithms
- Data types and structures
- Constants
- Exception handling
- Working with libraries
- HTTP protocol and how to interact with it using code
- Well, just a beautiful logic of interaction of procedures
